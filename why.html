<h1>Why?</h1>

<p>
  <a href="http://www.sparkjava.com/">SparkJava</a> has an excellent <a
  href="http://www.sparkjava.com/why.html">Why?</a> page
  up that covers why they decided to make a <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">SinatraRB</a> clone for Java.
</p>

<p>Here's the money quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  Spark focuses on being as simple and straight-forward as possible, without the need for cumbersome (XML)
  configuration, to enable very fast web application development in pure Java with minimal effort.
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<h2>SparkGS</h2>

<p>
  SparkGS is an extension of SparkJava that leverages the many advantages of the <a href="http://gosu-lang.org/">Gosu
  programming language</a> over Java.
</p>
<p>
  It allows you to define your spark program in a way that is much closer to the SinatraRB approach (in
  a simple program file) while giving you a few higher-level route definition tools for things like REST-ful URLS
  and RPC-style routes. And since Gosu offers type-safe templating out of the box, there is no need to install
  an awkward 3rd party templating system.
</p>

<p>
  SparkGS makes it dead simple to get a JVM based web-server going and it is trivially easy to deploy to
  <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, making SparkGS the easiest way we know of to get a JVM application
  up and going in the cloud.
</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
